# Supported languages

[Automatically generated JSON](https://github.com/mozilla/translations/tree/main/pipeline/langs/all_autogenerated.json) with supported language codes.

We use BCP-47 like language codes that allow us to use them as a label for Taskcluster, 
parse in various tools and accommodate different specialized use cases like training region-specific and low-resource languages, multilingual models etc.

The language codes should be supported by [ICU](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/).

Examples:

Code | Language variant
--- | ---
en  | English
ru | Russian
nb | Norwegian Bokmal
sq | Albanian
zh | Chinese in Simplified script (ICU default)
zh_hant | Chinese in Traditional script
sr_cyrl | Serbian in Cyrillic
pt_br | Brazilian Portuguese
ca_valencia | Catalan Valencia
hbs | Macro language for Serbo-Croatian group


The code for language support and mappings to various tools are encapsulated in the [pipeline/langs](https://github.com/mozilla/translations/tree/main/pipeline/langs) module.

The current supported languages are defined in [pipeline/langs/maps.py](https://github.com/mozilla/translations/tree/main/pipeline/langs/maps.py).

We generate a JSON for all langauge codes supported by the pipeline: [pipeline/langs/all_autogenerated.json](https://github.com/mozilla/translations/tree/main/pipeline/langs/all_autogenerated.json).
It is useful to verify languages codes for specific tools.
To regenerate run:
```bash
task generate-langs-map
```

To add support for a new code, add it to `PIPELINE_SUPPORT`, regenerate the JSON and adjust mappings for various tools if needed.
