            Upload the `task-graph.json` artifact from the Decision task to long
            term storage. This file contains the task ids and definitions of all
            tasks created by this decision task.

            The file is uploaded to a top-level `experiments` directory and includes
            src_locale, trg_locale, experiment name, and decision task id to ensure
            uniqueness.
