            Compute the cross-entropy score for each sentence in the teacher-synthesized
            distillation data. This dataset is used for student training. This score is
            the cross-entropy cost of the translation as computed by the backtranslations
            model. This represents a probability that the synthesized sentence could be
            generated by the target sentence.
