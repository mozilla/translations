            Upload artifacts from parts of the training pipeline to long term storage.

            All included tasks have their log files uploaded. Aside from that, the following
            tasks have all of their other files uploaded:
                * backtranslations-train-backwards-model
                * distillation-student-model-finetune
                * distillation-student-model-quantize
                * distillation-student-model-train
                * train-teacher-model
                * export
                * All evaluate tasks

            `corpus-align-*` tasks will only have their artifacts uploaded if `experiment.archive_corpora`
            is `true` in the training configuration.

            Destinations use include src_locale, trg_locale, experiment name, decision task id
            and a distinct directory for each task to ensure uniqueness and avoid overwrites.

            Additionally, logs are uploaded to a top-level `logs` directory while other artifacts
            are uploaded to a top-level `models` directory.

        from-deps:
            # Generate a separate `upload-artifacts` task for each task generated
            # by each entry in `kind-dependencies`. These tasks will have one upstream
            # task: the one they are uploading artifacts from. They will run
            # immediately after each task (ie: they depend on nothing else, have no
            # relation to one another).
