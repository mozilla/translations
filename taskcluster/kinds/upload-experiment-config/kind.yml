            Upload the experiment config (aka training config) to long term storage.

            Configs are uploaded to a top-level `experiments` directory and include
            src_locale, trg_locale, experiment name, and decision task id to ensure
            uniqueness.

                src_locale: training_config.experiment.src

            # indefinitely. PRs and manual training runs from PRs fall into
            # this category, and thus we hardcode it here to avoid, eg:
            # manual training runs from PRs accidentally uploading to the
            # release bucket. Sometimes other manual training runs can also
            # be in this category (eg: for testing work on `dev-` branches).

            # (moz-fx-translations-data--303e-prod-translations-data) and
            # should be used when preserving artifacts indefinitely is
            # important. This is the default in the training config but can
            # be adjusted when needed.
